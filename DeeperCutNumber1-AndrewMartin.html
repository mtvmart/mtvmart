<!--Deeper Cut #1. This week we will only work on this document.  


What follows is an explanation of how the Leaflet Map works... Press the thunderbolt button on the right to see what the map looks like or simply look how these instructions are renedered in Canvas.-->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!--Connects us the internet and makes sense text/syntax Instructions to the web browser about what version our HTML is written in-->
<html>

<head> <!--The Head is the foundation. Remember we are working over the web - therefore we need to communicate with/send instructions to external servers (Actually existing machines located somewhere in the world). The scripts below are content delivery networks and stylesheets - our ability to program is based on our connection to these networks. We are connecting to a server so we can send instructions to it-->

    <title>First Map - Andrew Martin</title>  
    
    <!-- 
The title is what shows up in your browser tab. Live preview the map by clicking on the horizontal thunderbolt in the upper right corner of brackets. It should open a new brower window with grey map that contains a marker,    circle, and polygon. 

Now change the black text inbetween the title tags to something else. Press Control S (to save) and press live preview you again. You should see what you changed to in the       
  browser tab.

Also notice how this text is in gray - above 'The title a few lines above you see an angled bracket, an exclamation mark and a few dashed lines. This gray writing is not being parsed into machine language - it's meant for   us to communicate with each other (other people looking at your code and so you can remember how the code is worker),

Everything and I mean absolutely everything that appears on this page that isn't gray is 
   being read as instructions for computer - thus any odd or wrong character can cause an error in your program. 

You will also notice that 'title' is in blue, while 'your first map' (or what you wrote 
   to replace it) is in black. Color in Brackets signifies different types of values. These colors help you read your program and problem solve within it. 

You will use this gray text or what we sometimes call 'commenting out' in your 'explain 
   how the program works' assignments. It's also very helpful to hold onto pieces of code you like or work, but want to turn off to see how the rest of the program works. This helps when locating an error. You can go block by block or line by line to see where the error is.

If you are having trouble reading this text you can copy and paste into another program or increase the size of the text in Brackets. 

You can either highlight the text and go to the edit toolbar and click toggle block 
   comment or look for the shortcut. I am a using a Mac and its option+command+backslash. If your code is not commented properly the server will interpret your human words as computer words - that ain't going to work. Error City!

Note that commenting out code looks different for HTML, CSS, and JS. You can see how our 
   document object model works by clicking on the tags <>. Note: If you are intrested in a more detailed explanations of these terms I recommend W3 Schools. The link is in the first lecture.

For example - see the <STYLE> tags below this set of grey text. This is the part of the 
   document responsible for CSS or styling rules. This is where you would select an object in the program and change it's appearance. More about this later... but I encourage you to go through the document and click on the tags. Where do they start? Where do they end? How is the notation different for starting the tag vs. completing it? <> vs. </>

Please also note how different kinds of brackets work - the three kinds we will be using 
   are [], (), and {}. Each has a different significance in JS - which will be written in the script tags. Press command + F (or control depending on your OS) Find 'var circle' Text or string values are written using quotes. In brackets they appear orange. You should find 'var circle' in the script tags. Variables are boxes that store values... more on this later. What I want you to do here is click on the different brackets - they indicate scope and scale. The connecting green brackets of the same kind indicate the start and stop of a process in your program. Sometimes we call this a block of code (particulary for code executed between curly braces)

If you find a curly {} on the same line as 'circle' you will see that it connects (as 
    indicated by being highlighted in green) with another bracket of the same kind (opening and closing - this is scope - we will explore it more later in the class). They open and close - everything inside those brackets is related to each other. The brackets help us make sense of the program. When first looking at a program we might scared - it might be incomprehensible, but we use these techniques to udnerstand it. Finding out where different blocks of code open and close we can follow a chain of execution - find out what it's accomplishing. Think about this and other tricks as diagnostics... think about the doctor that measures your blood pressure or the car mechanic that checks the oil.

Time to break the program. Go ahead and delete that opening curly { on the same line as       'var circle'. Now find the curly next to 'addto(mymap). You will find that's it's         red. Red brackets are missing a    
    partner. A missing bracket will break your map. This     is the most commone error you will run into. Look for those broken brackets. If you       see one, it means you should troubleshoot by adding a bracket - they should all be  green on a functioning map. To get your map back to functioning form simply press control (or command) + z. This will bring the map back to it's previous working state.

With the red bracket still showing save and press the horizontal bolt (live preview). The 
    map has dissapeared. If you right click, press inspect and then click on console in the toolbar (on top of the window that just popped up) it will tell you 'SyntaxError: Unexpected Token. This is the most common error. 

You are ok. Press control Z in brackets. Get that bracket back and save. Your map should work again.

What are in these curly brackets anyway? There are options for the circle - they style 
    the circle. These are called property/value forms. They are often seen inside 'objects' More on this later in the semester as this will be one of your primary tools in all JS libraries to cusomize your map's appearance. For now - you just be aware that they exist. 

Let's go back to that console. We will be there all the time this semester! Every browser   has web developer tools that give us clues about how the program works. 

That live preview button we used earlier - what is it? It shows us what this program (a   
  series of instructions for a computer) will look like in a web browser. If all is right the live preview should give you a working map (for what this program is supposed to do using Leaflet) If you right click on your web page there should be an option for inspect. This will pull up your developer tools. This very important menu can also be accessed with a shortcut (command + option + I for Mac) 

Under the elements section of the web developer tools (pops up when you press inspect) 
  you get to click on different parts of your program using the Document Object Model (DOM) Play with the dropdown arrows. Do the tags look familiar (from Brackets) This is another diagnostic to help you see what different parts of your program do.

Now click on the console tab. The console allows you to talk to your program. Type circle 
  in next to the little blue bracket near the bottom of the web development tools window. 

There is so much going on! Click on teh drop down arrows! Whoa! This is why a library is   so useful. We only need to write a few instructions and all of these code is written     for us. You can do this with any of the variables. In this program it's polygon and  
  marker.

We usually console log using You will be 
  doing a lot of console logging. You can for example console log the variable circle. Go ahead make this statement live. I included it under var circle. 

Once you have commented it back in (the same way you comment out). PRESS CONTROL (or   
  Command) + S. This will save and update the live preview. This is so important! If you don't save your changes your map will not change. Even if you save you can still use control + z so don't feel like you are setting something in stone - only temporarily!

If you have uncommented by console.log statement and saved in brackets your map should be 
  updated - it will look the same but if you find inspect (that menu we accessed before) You should see what the variable circle is. This is another powerful tool for undestanding what different parts of your program (instructions to create a map) do. 

Now try it yourself! Try writing a console log statement for polygon underneath the   
  instanitation (computer programming language for creating) of var poygon. What do you see in the console? Don't forget to save and remember this is being interpreted by computer. You have to be exact! Make sure everything is spelled right and the periods and parenthesis are in the right place!

Finally write 2 other console.log statements. 

a) Your favorite song lyric. Since it is a string it must go in quotes console.log(DMX and my Dogs Bite...") 

b) and try some math such as console.log(8+8)

 <div id="mapid"></div>
    
<!--What's this. A div tag. You create a space on the map. Most web mapping libraries need a space (think of it as an empty placeholder, in which to put something) 
    
This div tag which we named 'mapid" has an ID, which means we will only be using this 
    place holder one time. It has special properties. We refer an ID as #. Scroll down to the style tags. Find #mapid. You will see that it has an absolute position. This means it will take up the entire screen. You can add headers and footers to the map - we will do that later in the semester. We are styling the empty place. You can go to elements in your browser developer tools (inspect) to take a closer look at it. -->

//Assignment 

// 1. Change the center and zoom of the map to your home town
// 2. Give the circle, polygon, and marker meaning. Put them in places important to you. Use the bindPopup method to name what these places are.
// 3. Make the circle a different color than red and double it's size
// 4. Change the Fill Opacity to 1
// 5. Change the popup to a tooltip using the Leaflet documentation. Explain in your presentation what the difference between a tooltip and a popup is. 
// 6. Make the text in the tooltip bold 
// 7. Add an property/value pair to the circle options. See the Leaflet documentation for details.  
// 8. Change the basemap!
